This folder is intentionally committed (do **not** add it to `.gitignore`).

- The challenge requires a custom context file `product.md` to teach the assistant about local nuances.
- Canonical context lives at the repo root: `product.md`.
- A copy is kept here for easy discovery during review.

Suggested prompt when using an AI assistant:
- "Use `product.md` as ground truth. Recommend 3 street-food options given my budget, spice tolerance, time of day, and veg/non-veg preference. Explain why each matches, using only the context data."
